Tyler's silly story

Long, long ago, a little boy, Tod, was having his fifth birthday. When the party was ongoing, 
someone knocked on the door. Tod went to open the door and there was an old lady standing 
outside the door. She gave little Tod a seed for his birthday present and left with no
words.
