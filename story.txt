Tyler's silly story

Long, long ago, a little boy, Tod, was having his fifth birthday. When the party was ongoing, 
someone knocked on the door. Tod went to open the door and there was an old lady standing 
outside the door. She gave little Tod a seed for his birthday present and left with no
words. These seeds are very strange because they are colorful and huge, even looks very juicy. Tod feels an implus to eat it without telling anyone. He hides in a corner with no friends and eat all the seeds. The taste of these are delicious and he can't stop. After he ate them, he feels a superpower from his body but he don't know what is his new power. So he comes to one of his friends......
He knocked on the door and his friend Tom opened the door. But Tom looked around and closed the door! Tod was surprised and knocked once again. This time Tod shouted when Tom opened the door, "Tom, I am here, can you see me?"
